    <h1>Plants in Apartments</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Providing an overview of houseplants which thrive in small apartments, information about their care, as well as common issues that plague many plant owners. We include a number of images and examples to show real-world examples of what it's really like to take care of plants in a small, rented space.</p>
  
  <div class = "intro">
      <p>Plants are a wonderful addition to any living space. They provide greenery, oxygen, and are scientifically proven to increase happiness! Living in a small apartment, however, can pose unique challenges to plant ownership. Often plants struggle to thrive in spaces without much light, and when in a small space, pests and disease spread more easily! But fear not, this site is here to show examples of plants which do well in apartments and help you troubleshoot common issues.</p>
